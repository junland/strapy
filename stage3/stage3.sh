# We construct a chroot environment that has an empty layout, that is  #
# used to natively build the final system. To achieve this, some quick #
# compatibility work is done, such as building musl and the system     #
# headers.
#
# We bind-mount the stage2 support environment to the /serpent tree    #
# and add it to the end of the PATH environmental variable. This lets  #
# us use the native compiler, libs, etc, to natively build all of our  #
# needed software and install to the root of the tree.                 #
#                                                                      #
